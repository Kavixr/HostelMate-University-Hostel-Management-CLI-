# 🏨 HostelMate – University Hostel Management (CLI)

A **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application designed to manage hostel operations at universities.  
The system provides **secure login**, **student management**, and key hostel functionalities such as **room management**, **bed allocation**, and **report generation** — all through a simple text-based interface.


## 🔐 1. Login to the System

The system starts with a secure **login screen** that prompts the user to enter their username and password.  
If incorrect credentials are entered, the system automatically **re-prompts** until valid details are provided.

### ✨ Features
- Prompts for **Username** and **Password**  
- Validates credentials and re-prompts if invalid  
- Displays a **success message** with the logged-in username  

### 💬 Sample Console Output
```
=== HostelMate Login ===
Username: ****
Password: ****
Login successful. Welcome, warden!
```
